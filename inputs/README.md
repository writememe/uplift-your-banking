# Input File Examples

Follow the example files and populate your budget:

[JSON File Example](./example-budget.json)  
[CSV File Example](./example-budget.csv)  

Essentially, you need to build a list of each `tag` and an associated `weekly_budget`. You could use any datasource and long as you can load it into a Pandas dataframe.
